                <p>Let me first introduce myself. My name is Brian Jennings and I've been a home inspector for 30+
                    years!
                    I started out doing pest control with my father in California then we branched out and included home
                    inspections.
                    I later moved to Daingerfield, TX in 2014 and couldn't be happier! I started this business on my own
                    and have been
                    serving the East Texas community since.
                </p>
                <p>Whether you are buying your first home, your 50th home, selling, or a realtor looking for a solid
                    inspector, I'm your guy!
                    I have many contacts and relationships throughout East Texas and am excited to make more! Buying or
                    selling a home can be
                    quite the event, and I'm here to make it as smooth and pain-free as possible.

                    <h3>Buying</h3>
                    <p>Buying a home is one of the most delicate processes in the professional world. Therer are so many
                        moving parts,
                        forms to fill out and sign, and so on. The last thing you want to do is move in to your lovely
                        new home, and BAM!,
                        house is completely flooded or the A/C just doesn't work. That's what I'm here to prevent! I
                        have a complete and thourough
                        process which makes sure that the home you're buying isn't complete garbage! When you hire me,
                        you're hiring confirmation
                        that the home you just agreed 30-years to pay for is going to last.

            <div class="selling">
                <h3>Selling</h3>
                <p>You may not think you need an inspector when you sell your house, but the answer is, you should!
                    Nothing can destory a home sale quick like an inspection going south when your days into escrow.
                    Why not prevent all that mess by getting your home inspected before listing it! This way, when your
                    soon to be buyers get it inspected, you've already fixed those pesky little issues that seem to pop
                    up.
                    This makes it look like your home is well taken care of and a great buy!

                <h3>Realtors</h3>
                <p>Hello fellow real estate gurus! Finding professional relationship in real estate can be a daunting
                    task.
                    I'm here to make that easy. I make baskets of goodies for all my real estate buddies! This is not to
                    "woo" you per-se, but
                    it is something I enjoy doing just to make you happy! I am well acquainted with the whole escrow
                    process and what comes next, etc.
                    Having a contact in the inspection world is a great tool to make sure your clients keep coming back!
